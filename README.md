## Tasks
1. Successfully connect the Website to the API to receive a green thumbs up.
2. Through the API make a call to the data source(https://restcountries.eu/). To return the list of country names to the UI.
3. Cache the call to the data source(https://restcountries.eu/) so the call is not called on every request.
4. Paginate the list of countries on the UI, displaying the country name and the flag of the country.
5. Ability to click on a country and display extra information on the country
  i.e. population, time zones, currencies, language, capital city and bordering countries.

Please ensure that all code is completed to a standard that you would consider production ready - Feel free to change the template provided if you feel necessary

## Remarks
1. This test is very extensive if you consider doing both front and backend in TDD.
2. I can safely manage frontend implementation, but I am way stronger in the backend;
3. Do not mind the ugly layout. I am not a web designer but could have done better with extra time available.
4. I had to cut it short after having spent many hours with the implementatiuon. I do not believe it is production ready yet due to:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There are some tests missing for the frontend part;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Country Details panel should become a component itself, in my opinion;  
**Nevertheless, I am confident that what was implemented can provide enough insight regarding my skills.**
